        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A warm bowl of clam chowder is the perfect starter for a meal. If you follow this recipe and make the chowder from scratch, 
        you will notice a huge flavor difference from store-bought canned chowder. This version of clam chowder is very creamy and flavorful.</p>
    
        <p>This dish is a good source of meat and dairy.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable stock</li>
            <li>2 (6.5-ounce) cans chopped clams, juices reserved</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 cup half and half</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large stockpot over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes.
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving 1 tablespoon excess fat; set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in the stockpot. Add garlic and onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions have become translucent,
            about 2-3 minutes. Stir in thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, vegetable stock, clam juice and bay leaf,
            and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in potatoes.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 12-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in half and half and clams until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. If the
            soup is too thick, add more half and half as needed until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Garnish with bacon and parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
