        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A warm bowl of clam chowder is the perfect starter for a meal. If you follow this recipe and make the chowder from scratch, 
        you will notice a huge flavor difference from store-bought canned chowder. This version of clam chowder is very creamy and flavorful.</p>
    
        <p>This dish is a good source of meat and dairy.</p>
